[["index.html", "Analysis of FIFA Players Chapter 1 Introduction", " Analysis of FIFA Players Matthieu Schulz, Hugo Ginoux, Ryan McNamara 2022-12-15 Chapter 1 Introduction Football is the most popular sport in the world. As football fans ourselves and because the World Cup is currently ongoing, we have chosen on working on questions surrounding this amazing sport for our final project. There are more than 240 million football players registered to a club and billions of more fans. Every 4 years an international tournament, The World Cup, captivates billions of fans from all countries, making it the most-watched sporting event around the globe. Football fans often try and compare their favorite players and one can easily gather information about their height, weight, salary, goals, etc., however, comparisons between players can become subjective and difficult without an official ranking. FIFA, a video game franchise, allows one to simulate football matches (on PS5 and Xbox among others), provides rankings of players and their attributes. The game is released annually by Electronic Arts (EA), with updated players and statistics, is a fan favorite among sports video games. Unsurprisingly, FIFA is the highest-selling sports video game, selling 260 million copies as of 2022 (the next highest is Madden, with over 130 million copies sold) (source). While specific ratings are not available in the real world of football, using the data from the FIFA video games allows us to analyze players and their skills in a more quantitative, rather than qualitative way. The tremendous interest in football worldwide makes this a fascinating topic with a plethora of insights to uncover. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic The amount of data that is contained in FIFA video games is colossal. For instance, the newest release, FIFA 23, features more than 19,000 players across 700 teams. Each of these players is assigned specific ratings for over 100 attributes, such as speed, strength, mentality, striking, goalkeeping, etc. Moreover, since 2016, the game has included female players and female teams. The vast amount of data that present in one of these games is enough to conduct a variety of compelling analysis and visualizations. The specific ratings given to each player allow us to explore correlations and patterns between variables. A few possible ways to analysis the data (more of this in 2.2) are: seeing how overall rating influences salary, what the height distribution is by position, and how specific players’ ratings changed over time. 2.2 Data availability For the purpose of this project, we will be using the following FIFA datasets: https://sports-statistics.com/soccerl/fifa-2022-dataset-csvs/ Electronic Arts Website: https://www.ea.com/sports FIFA is updated yearly with a new release (i.e. FIFA 21 for 2021, FIFA 22 for 2022, etc.). Thus, the players, teams, and ratings are kept current with each release. The origin of the data is the Electronic Arts company, which determines the ratings of teams and players and creates the game every year. Although the game is created by Electronic Arts, the datasets we are going to use were curated by a website called sports-statistics.com. More specifically, our datasets were created by Thomas Nielson, a writer for the website. In order to create the datasets, the author scraped the data for each player from a website called sofifa.com. This website keeps track of each players attributes/ratings for each release of the FIFA video game. The data we are using is scraped directly off of this website with minimal preprocessing/cleaning. The website sports-statistics.com appears to be a reliable website that provides datasets for different sports, including basketball, baseball, football, and soccer. Our specific datasets were included in a short article written by Thomas Nielson, who writes for the website and has published many other sports datasets. We found multiple other websites (including Data World and Kaggle) that provided datasets of FIFA players. However, these datasets did not include multiple years, were filtered and preprocessed already, or were not consistently udated. If we have any questions or concerns about our datasets, we can directly contact the website and Thomas Nielson via a “Contact Us” link on their website. A brief explanation of the format of the dataset is given below: The dataset that we are going to use for this project is actually a collection of datasets. We have identified datasets documenting important player statistics from the FIFA video games for both the male and female players in the game. Each dataset contains the data for a single release of the FIFA video game (i.e. a particular year). For the male players, we have 8 datasets that correspond to the years 2015 through 2022. For the female players, we have 7 datasets that correspond to the years 2016 through 2022 (female players and teams were introduced in FIFA 2016). Each dataset contains the same number and type of features. Each row of the dataset corresponds to a player, and they are ordered in decreasing overall rating. There are over 100 features (columns) in each of the datasets. A few of the columns are as follows: name, position (both for a club team and national team), foot preference, height, weight, wage, value, overall rating, attribute ratings (i.e. attacking, defending, striking, goalkeeping, speed, dribbling, stamina, mentality, etc.), nationality, etc. The dataset also contains a column for links to the website that the player attributes/ratings were collected from. A few of the columns are formatted in a way that is not optimal for data analysis and visualization, so preprocessing and cleaning will be necessary. For example, for players that play multiple positions, their positions are under the same column and separated with a comma. Also, player tags are included with a ‘#’ preceding them and multiple are included in the same column. We obviously will not use every attribute that is present in the dataset, and thus we must clean the columns we wish to use and discard the rest. We plan on conducting analyses of player statistics from the year 2022, along with temporal analysis across the releases. In order to do this, we will combine all of the datasets after adding a “year” column. The concatenation should be simple using “rbind.” The datasets are available in two different formats: as individual CSV files and as a single Excel file with sheets corresponding to the years. We prefer to use the CSV files since having individual files for each year is more organized. With this simple format, we will import the datasets into R using the “read_csv” function in R. Using this function, we will easily be able to view the datasets as individual data.frames before concatenating them. Following are some ideas we have for data exploration: We are interested in exploring the height distribution of players based on their position for both men and women. Is height preferred in some positions more than others? In what positions does height provide an advantage for performance? We are interested in performing dimensionality reduction using PCA to see if we can identify clusters of players that have similar skill sets. If we color code points based on position, do we see those positions grouped together in the biplot based on their attribute ratings? How does overall rating influence player salary? Are there specific attributes that are more desirable and lead to a higher salary? How do the salaries compare between men and women? This can be explored in a few ways: comparing all men to all women, comparing within the same country, comparing between counties, and comparing based on the overall rating. How do the ratings of our favorite players change over time, both overall and for specific attributes? Which attributes are negatively correlated and which are positively correlated? For example: as age increases, speed might decrease while mentality increases. "],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Cleaning/Transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis", " Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources For this project, we will be using the following FIFA datasets: https://sports-statistics.com/soccerl/fifa-2022-dataset-csvs/ Electronic Arts Website: https://www.ea.com/sports Every year, Electronic Arts releases a new version of the FIFA video game (i.e. FIFA 21 for 2021, FIFA 22 for 2022, etc.). Every year, the attributes and statistics of current players are updated and reevaluated, which keeps the game current. The origin of the data that we are working with is the Electronic Arts company, which determines the ratings of the teams and players when they design the newest release of the game. We are collecting our data from a website called sports-statistics.com. The website is a collection of sports analysts which collect video game/sports data to post online so interested fans can analyze and extract insights from it. Specifically, our dataset was created by Thomas Nielson, a writer for the website. The author collected the data from a website called sofifa.com, which is a website that keeps track of all of the players attributes/statistics with every release of the FIFA video game. The data that we’ve collected is scraped directly off of this website with minimal preprocessing/cleaning. We looked at other websites for collecting this type of data, such as Data World and Kaggle, however, the dataset we found contains the most complete information regarding the attributes of every player (both male and female) since 2015. The other datasets we came across also had a lot of preprocessing/cleaning applied to them. The sports-statistics website is reliable and accurate. We performed some background research on the author of the dataset, Thomas Nielson, and found that he has published many other sports datasets on the website. We were unable to find anything negative about the dataset, the website, or the creator. We were also pleasantly surpised to find a link with which we can directly contact Thomas Nielson if we have any troubles with the dataset or find any errors. We will now provide a brief overview of the dataset we collected. The dataset that we are going to use is actually a collection of datasets. We have identified datasets documenting important player statistics from the FIFA video games for both male and female players in the game. Each of the datasets we collected corresponds to a single release of the FIFA video game (i.e. a particular year). We have 8 datasets for the males, ranging from 2015 through 2022. For the females, we have 7 datasets that correspond to the years 2016 through 2022 (female players were added to the game in 2016). Fortunately, each of the datasets contains the same number and type of features/variables. Within the datasets, each row correponds to an individual player. Each dataset contains over 100 features, such as: name, position, foot preference, height, weight, wage, value, overall rating, attribute ratings (i.e. attacking, defending, speed, dribbling, goalkeeping, etc.), nationality, etc. These are the attributes that are coded into the video game, which gives the players their unique abilities within the game. Each of the attribute ratings has a max of 99 and a minimum of 1 (although no player has any attribute that is that low). Importantly, each of the players has a link to the website where these attributes were collected from, which enhances our confidence in the data. Many of the variables within the dataset are numeric variables. For example, like mentioned before, all of the ratings are a discrete value from 1 to 99. Some of the other columns, such as the name columns and nationality columns, are categorical variables in the form of text. After concatenating all of the datasets for each of the years and for female and male players, we have 144,323 records in the dataset. 3.2 Cleaning/Transformation In terms of cleaning and transformation, we need to first combine all of the individual datasets into one master dataset. Since all of the datasets have the same number and types of columns, we simply are using “rbind” to combine the datasets. We are combining all of the individual years of data we have, along with the male and female versions. In order to be able to differentiate between the datasets later, we add a column for the gender of the player and the year of the release. fem_16 = read.csv(&#39;data/female_players_16.csv&#39;) fem_16$release_year = &#39;2016&#39; fem_17 = read.csv(&#39;data/female_players_17.csv&#39;) fem_17$release_year = &#39;2017&#39; fem_18 = read.csv(&#39;data/female_players_18.csv&#39;) fem_18$release_year = &#39;2018&#39; fem_19 = read.csv(&#39;data/female_players_19.csv&#39;) fem_19$release_year = &#39;2019&#39; fem_20 = read.csv(&#39;data/female_players_20.csv&#39;) fem_20$release_year = &#39;2020&#39; fem_21 = read.csv(&#39;data/female_players_21.csv&#39;) fem_21$release_year = &#39;2021&#39; fem_22 = read.csv(&#39;data/female_players_22.csv&#39;) fem_22$release_year = &#39;2022&#39; female_players = rbind(fem_16, fem_17, fem_18, fem_19, fem_20, fem_21, fem_22) male_15 = read.csv(&#39;data/players_15.csv&#39;) male_15$release_year = &#39;2015&#39; male_16 = read.csv(&#39;data/players_16.csv&#39;) male_16$release_year = &#39;2016&#39; male_17 = read.csv(&#39;data/players_17.csv&#39;) male_17$release_year = &#39;2017&#39; male_18 = read.csv(&#39;data/players_18.csv&#39;) male_18$release_year = &#39;2018&#39; male_19 = read.csv(&#39;data/players_19.csv&#39;) male_19$release_year = &#39;2019&#39; male_20 = read.csv(&#39;data/players_20.csv&#39;) male_20$release_year = &#39;2020&#39; male_21 = read.csv(&#39;data/players_21.csv&#39;) male_21$release_year = &#39;2021&#39; male_22 = read.csv(&#39;data/players_22.csv&#39;) male_22$release_year = &#39;2022&#39; male_players = rbind(male_15, male_16, male_17, male_18, male_19, male_20, male_21, male_22) female_players$gender = &#39;F&#39; male_players$gender = &#39;M&#39; all_players = rbind(female_players, male_players) head(all_players) ## sofifa_id player_url ## 1 226324 https://sofifa.com/player/226324/carli-lloyd/160002 ## 2 226328 https://sofifa.com/player/226328/megan-rapinoe/160002 ## 3 226334 https://sofifa.com/player/226334/abby-wambach/160002 ## 4 226362 https://sofifa.com/player/226362/louisa-necib/160002 ## 5 226373 https://sofifa.com/player/226373/nadine-kessler/160002 ## 6 226359 https://sofifa.com/player/226359/christine-sinclair/160002 ## short_name long_name player_positions overall potential ## 1 C.

For example, since some of the players see fluctuations in their attribute ratings during the lifespan of the game, some of the ratings are encoded in a form such as: “55+3”. Thus, we must take only the first two numbers from the rating and turn it into a numeric rating, rather than a string/character rating. This occurs only in the columns that provide a rating for specific attributes of the players. defaultW &lt;- getOption(&quot;warn&quot;) options(warn = -1) clean_col=function(dataset, col){ column = dataset[, col] str_to_num = function(x){ return(as.numeric(substr(x, 1, 2))) } return(sapply(column, FUN = str_to_num)) } for (col in c(&quot;ls&quot;,&quot;st&quot;,&quot;rs&quot;,&quot;lw&quot;,&quot;lf&quot;,&quot;cf&quot;,&quot;rf&quot;,&quot;rw&quot;,&quot;lam&quot;,&quot;cam&quot;,&quot;ram&quot;,&quot;lm&quot;,&quot;lcm&quot;,&quot;cm&quot;,&quot;rcm&quot;,&quot;rm&quot;,&quot;lwb&quot;,&quot;ldm&quot;,&quot;cdm&quot;,&quot;rdm&quot;,&quot;rwb&quot;,&quot;lb&quot;,&quot;lcb&quot;,&quot;cb&quot;,&quot;rcb&quot;,&quot;rb&quot;,&quot;gk&quot;)){ #print(col) all_players[,col]=clean_col(all_players, col) male_players[,col]=clean_col(male_players, col) female_players[,col]=clean_col(female_players, col) male_22[,col]=clean_col(male_22, col) fem_22[,col]=clean_col(fem_22, col) } Lastly, there is some data cleaning/transformation that we will do as we go through the analysis. For example, since players often play multiple positions, their positions played are comma separated within the same cell. When we analyze characteristics of specific positions, we will separate each of these positions to be included in their own unique row. Since that will cause duplication of a lot of players, we neglect to do that here and only perform the cleaning operation when it is needed within the analysis. We also will leave all of the columns of the dataset intact, rather than removing some of them now, and will use “select” to grab the ones that are necessary for our later analysis. 3.3 Missing value analysis Let’s start by checking how many missing values are in each column. ## nation_team_id nation_jersey_number ## 133635 133635 ## goalkeeping_speed release_clause_eur ## 128249 57780 ## mentality_composure pace ## 32026 16074 ## shooting passing ## 16074 16074 ## dribbling defending ## 16074 16074 ## physic league_level ## 16074 4259 ## value_eur club_team_id ## 4095 3874 ## club_jersey_number club_contract_valid_until ## 3874 3874 ## wage_eur club_name ## 3820 2244 ## league_name club_position ## 2244 2244 ## club_loaned_from club_joined ## 2244 2244 ## club_logo_url club_flag_url ## 2244 2244 ## gk sofifa_id ## 189 0 ## player_url short_name ## 0 0 ## long_name player_positions ## 0 0 ## overall potential ## 0 0 ## age dob ## 0 0 ## height_cm weight_kg ## 0 0 ## nationality_id nationality_name ## 0 0 ## nation_position preferred_foot ## 0 0 ## weak_foot skill_moves ## 0 0 ## international_reputation work_rate ## 0 0 ## body_type real_face ## 0 0 ## player_tags player_traits ## 0 0 ## attacking_crossing attacking_finishing ## 0 0 ## attacking_heading_accuracy attacking_short_passing ## 0 0 ## attacking_volleys skill_dribbling ## 0 0 ## skill_curve skill_fk_accuracy ## 0 0 ## skill_long_passing skill_ball_control ## 0 0 ## movement_acceleration movement_sprint_speed ## 0 0 ## movement_agility movement_reactions ## 0 0 ## movement_balance power_shot_power ## 0 0 ## power_jumping power_stamina ## 0 0 ## power_strength power_long_shots ## 0 0 ## mentality_aggression mentality_interceptions ## 0 0 ## mentality_positioning mentality_vision ## 0 0 ## mentality_penalties defending_marking_awareness ## 0 0 ## defending_standing_tackle defending_sliding_tackle ## 0 0 ## goalkeeping_diving goalkeeping_handling ## 0 0 ## goalkeeping_kicking goalkeeping_positioning ## 0 0 ## goalkeeping_reflexes ls ## 0 0 ## st rs ## 0 0 ## lw lf ## 0 0 ## cf rf ## 0 0 ## rw lam ## 0 0 ## cam ram ## 0 0 ## lm lcm ## 0 0 ## cm rcm ## 0 0 ## rm lwb ## 0 0 ## ldm cdm ## 0 0 ## rdm rwb ## 0 0 ## lb lcb ## 0 0 ## cb rcb ## 0 0 ## rb player_face_url ## 0 0 ## nation_logo_url nation_flag_url ## 0 0 ## release_year gender ## 0 0 There are a lot of missing values for columns such as nation_team_id, nation_jersey_number, goalkeeping_speed, etc. These are because we have players that do not play for the national team or that do not goalkeep, so they have no values for these variables. This is not a big deal, we will not be using these variables in our analysis. We can’t visualize these missing values with a heat map because we have too many samples (players) in our dataset. We will plot the percentage of missing values for each column that has missing values instead. We see that we have a lot of missing values for nation_jersey_number, nation_team_id, and goalkeeping_speed. We discussed these missing values above. We also have some missing values for other attributes such as defending, dribbling, pace, etc. This is because some players are not given certain ratings, usually because they do not do those things (i.e. goalkeeping). Some of these values might also be missing because they were not attributes in the earlier years of the game. Either way, we will pay close attention to these missing values if we are going to be using these variables for our analysis. Let’s see if there are any missing patterns in the data. We will remove columns that are missing less than 20% of their values (since it is impossible to see what is going on with so many variables). There aren’t many patterns that emerge when looking at the missing values within our dataset. However, we can see that the most common pattern of missing values is missing the nation_team_id, nation_jersey_number, and goalkeeping_speed attributes. It makes sense that if a player does not play for the national team, then they will be missing the nation_team_id and the nation_jersey_number columns (which is also pattern 4). Most of the players in our dataset will be missing any of the attributes that are associated with being a goalkeeper, since a majority of the players are not goalkeepers and their attributes are very specific to them. We also see that we have very few complete rows within the dataset, again because almost every player has some attribute that is not assigned to them since they do not play the position or require that attribute. All in all, there are no striking patterns that emerge from the data regarding the missing values. Since the data contains a number of features that are URL’s, team/nation ids, etc., we expect there to be a large number of missing values. This is no issue, however, for our analysis because we will only be using what is required for each of our plots. We have also decided not to completely remove any column, as there is no need. We will simply be selecting the columns we want to use during our analysis of the dataset. If we were instead training a machine learning model, we obviously would have to remove the columns that would disrupt our analysis. Our goal of this section was to concatenate the datasets and preprocess the attribute ratings so that they are in a form that we can use. "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Analysis of Player Heights 4.2 Explaining Player Wages 4.3 Explaining Player Values 4.4 Clustering the players 4.5 Where are the best players from ? 4.6 Analysis of Male vs Female Salaries", " Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Analysis of Player Heights 4.1.1 Overall Distribution of Male and Female Heights We are first going to look at the overall distribution of players’ heights for both male and female. We obviously expect the median height of the men to be larger than the median height of women. For this analysis, we will only use the most recent year of data we have, specifically 2022. ## [1] &quot;Median Male Player Height: 181 cm&quot; ## [1] &quot;Median Female Player Height: 170 cm&quot; We can clearly see that the average male player is taller than the average female player. We can also see that the heights of both the male and female players are approximately normally distributed. The median male player height is 181 cm, while the median female player height is 170 cm. 4.1.2 Normality of Player Heights Let’s create a Q-Q plot for the males and females to confirm our hypothesis that the heights of each gender are normally distributed. We can see that both the female and male players’ heights are approximately normally distributed. The sample heights align very well with the theoretical heights based on a normal distribution. We can not do a Shapiro-Wilk test in this case since we have far more than 5,000 samples, but we can clearly see the approximate normal distribution from the Q-Q plot. This is not surprising, as we know that heights for the general population are normally distributed. 4.1.3 Median Player Height per Position Let’s get to the more interesting part of the analysis. We will visualize the median heights of both female and male players per position to see if there are some positions for which height is more of an asset than for others. We will again be using the data from 2022 only. Since most players play more than one position, we will include a row in our data for each position that the player plays. Thus, some (if not most) players will be included in the height calculation for multiple positions. The Cleveland Dot Plot above provides many interesting insights. First, we can confirm the above conclusion that the male players are taller than the female players. Further, we can see that this is true for every single position. For both the males and the females, the tallest player on the pitch tends to be the goalkeeper. The goalkeeper is in charge of protecting the net, thus, it makes sense for a goalkeeper to be tall in order to “cover” as much of the goal as possible. We also see that the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th tallest positions for the men are the center back (CB), striker (ST), and center defensive midfielder (CDM). These positions are also among the tallest for the women as well. The tallest players (besides the goalkeeper), tend to be the defensive players (center back (CB), center defensive midfielder (CDM), left back (LB), left wing back (LWB), etc.). This also is in agreement with what we know about football; the defensive players must be able to win headers to protect the goal, which height helps. Strikers are among the only offensive players to have large heights, for both the men and the women. Strikers tend to play in the box, meaning they must compete against the tall defensive players for headers. The smallest positions on the pitch tend to be the midfielders and offensive wing players (CAM, LM, RM, RW, LF, CF, etc.). Again, this makes sense. The midfielders and offensive wing players play in the middle and edges of the pitch. They need to be fast with the ball and be able to deliver crosses into the box. Thus, height is not as crucial as speed is for these positions. 4.1.4 Distribution of Player Height per Position Now, let’s take a look at the distribution of player heights per position. With the Cleveland Dot Plot we can see the median player height, but using a Ridgeline plot will also us to identify the modality of heights for each position. We again can see that goalkeepers and defensive players tend to be the tallest. The distribution for each position for the male players appears to be normally distributed. Interestingly, there seems to be some bimodality and uniform distribution of the heights for some of the female player positions. For example, there seems to be two groups of players for the RB position, one who are taller and ones who are shorter. For positions like CAM, RW, ST, and CM, the distribution seems almost uniform, with heights ranging over a 15 or 20 cm range. It seems that the heights of players might not be as crucial of an attribute for the women’s game as speed, for example. The women’s game is often played more on the ground than in the air, so speed and quickness could be more advantageous than height regardless of the position (except goalkeeper and some defensive positions). 4.2 Explaining Player Wages In this part, we want to identify what features are the most important to predict a player’s salary. The scope of the study will focus on the male players during the year 2021-22, excluding the goalkeepers. 4.2.1 Explaining wages by a simple scatter plot First, let’s have an insight by plotting the wages in function of the “overall” rating (the global level of a player) and his age. We can see from this graph that the wages grow with the overall rating of the player, that sounds natural. On the contrary, the age does not look like having a strong influence on the wages. Now, let’s perform a linear regression to compare the influence of each feature. 4.2.2 Explaining wages by Linear Regression We are trying to explain the wages given the data available in the other columns through a linear regression. When done, we keep only the 30 most significant coefficients (with the lowest p-value) and we plot them in a Cleveland dot plot to compare them. 4.2.2.1 Regression 1 We can see that the club name is clearly the best indicator to estimate the salary of a player. Indeed, clubs like PSG or Manchester City are well known to be extremely rich, because they benefit from the support of a country (Qatar and Saudi Arabia). Therefore, they are able to pay their players a lot, and this seems to have a much higher influence than the actual level of the player. Once this observation is done, let’s remove the feature “club_name” to observe the influence of the others. 4.2.2.2 Regression 2 Now, we can observe that features with the highest influence come from “league_name”, that is to say the country the player plays in. Indeed, the English Premier League (and the other big european championships) is famous for getting huge amounts of money from broadcasting rights and therefore overpaying its players. Once this observation is done, let’s remove the feature “league_name” to observe the influence of the others. 4.2.2.3 Regression 3 Here, we can notice that the position of the player becomes to most important feature. For instance, Center Forwards (CF) are much better paid than Right Defensive Midfielders (RDM), probably because the position is more “spectacular” and televisual. We can also remark that the international reputation is a very important feature to explain the salary. It can be explained by the fact that football is an open competitive market: if a player with a good reputation is not well paid, he is likely to get offers from other clubs and change during the summer. Once this observation is done, let’s remove the feature “club_position” to observe the influence of the others. 4.2.2.4 Regression 4 4.3 Explaining Player Values Now, we want to identify what features are the most important to predict a players value in the transfer market. 4.3.1 Explaining values by a simple scatter plot First, let’s have an insight by plotting the values in function of the “overall” rating and his age. We can see from this graph that the values grow with the overall rating of the player, that sounds natural (the more gifted a player, the higher his value). But unlike the wages study, here the age seems to have a strong influence on the values! Indeed, for the same overall rating, younger players clearly have a higher value. Now, let’s perform a linear regression to compare the influence of each feature. 4.3.2 Explaining values by Linear Regression We are trying to explain the values given the data available in the other columns through a linear regression. When done, we keep only the 30 most significant coefficients (with the lowest p-value) and we plot them in a Cleveland dot plot to compare them. 4.3.2.1 Regression 1 Like for the last study, the club name is the best way to estimate the value of a player. Indeed, it is known that the most prestigious clubs are able to attract the most valuable players. Once this observation is done, let’s remove the feature “club_name” to observe the influence of the others. 4.3.2.2 Regression 2 Now, like before, we can observe that features with the highest influence come from “league_name”, that is to say the country the player plays in. It is interesting to notice that the first league is not the English Premier League, but the Indian Super League, that is not a prestigious championship! It means that this league is probably a pool of young talents with high value, leaving the country when they reach a certain fame. Once this observation is done, let’s remove the feature “league_name” to observe the influence of the others. Here, we can notice that the position of the player becomes to most important feature. Center Forwards may be the highest paid position, it is not the one with the highest value! Left Wingers (LW) are more valuable. Once this observation is done, let’s remove the feature “club_position” to observe the influence of the others. Finally, we are left with only the pure skills and personality of the player. Once again, the international reputation was important, but we can now observe that ratings like “overall” or “movement_balance” are also good indicators. Finally, your age seems to strongly negatively impact your value, as we explained earlier. 4.4 Clustering the players In this part, let’s try to cluster the players into 3 groups, visualize them in the 2D plane generated by the 2 principal components of the PCA and infer some interesting thoughts. We can see that the clusters are very well separated in the pricipal components plane (explaining 70% of the variance). By hovering a little bit, we realize that the well-known players are in the leftmost cluster (number 3). Probably the left-to-right vector (pca_1) conveys the meaning of “fame” or “talent”. Let’s have a look on the centroids of the clusters to be sure. ## overall potential value_eur age height_cm weight_kg league_level ## 1 62.77917 69.20779 1082616 24.37939 183.1088 76.13522 1.413559 ## 2 62.89930 70.06209 1107344 23.52348 178.9606 72.58130 1.425883 ## 3 71.01614 73.90673 6040974 26.87958 179.2346 73.56735 1.252483 ## club_jersey_number weak_foot skill_moves international_reputation pace ## 1 20.34154 2.766489 2.040786 1.019842 62.00184 ## 2 24.54346 3.072565 2.613698 1.009313 71.77125 ## 3 18.25760 3.141837 2.851024 1.227188 70.67287 ## shooting passing dribbling defending physic attacking_crossing ## 1 36.26585 49.10344 52.82840 61.05530 66.67996 44.81812 ## 2 59.18646 54.56364 63.74350 32.20023 57.82208 51.34459 ## 3 60.40813 66.40705 69.82464 59.37058 68.82651 63.92070 ## attacking_finishing attacking_heading_accuracy attacking_short_passing ## 1 32.03950 58.11372 57.27852 ## 2 60.29569 52.31393 59.16414 ## 3 57.56487 58.45531 70.41620 ## attacking_volleys skill_dribbling skill_curve skill_fk_accuracy ## 1 31.90575 48.93055 37.93864 34.62943 ## 2 52.63038 63.50640 52.04540 45.18898 ## 3 53.50450 69.05897 62.11453 55.63206 ## skill_long_passing skill_ball_control movement_acceleration ## 1 51.36248 54.87378 61.48613 ## 2 49.77513 63.24874 71.83838 ## 3 65.98309 70.62135 70.97408 ## movement_sprint_speed movement_agility movement_reactions movement_balance ## 1 62.40401 57.24251 58.13430 60.04997 ## 2 71.68529 69.64707 57.83430 69.00737 ## 3 70.41077 72.02173 68.24069 70.88532 ## power_shot_power power_jumping power_stamina power_strength power_long_shots ## 1 46.65791 67.84659 64.82528 69.17252 34.38122 ## 2 62.06810 61.41521 61.19092 59.89464 55.53880 ## 3 67.41868 67.67381 74.27250 67.25574 61.43808 ## mentality_aggression mentality_interceptions mentality_positioning ## 1 62.38398 60.37718 40.06651 ## 2 47.39503 28.47516 60.51940 ## 3 66.08271 59.73588 64.07604 ## mentality_vision mentality_penalties mentality_composure ## 1 43.67647 40.46794 53.73764 ## 2 56.16938 56.80947 57.17831 ## 3 65.83271 56.53352 67.59885 ## defending_marking_awareness defending_standing_tackle ## 1 60.23167 63.14128 ## 2 30.66007 30.51960 ## 3 58.67489 60.60475 ## defending_sliding_tackle ls st rs lw lf ## 1 61.10674 48.59122 48.59122 48.59122 49.34117 48.76300 ## 2 28.78871 60.68976 60.68976 60.68976 61.50272 61.44975 ## 3 57.37322 64.79469 64.79469 64.79469 67.09590 66.74441 ## cf rf rw lam cam ram lm lcm ## 1 48.76300 48.76300 49.34117 49.61676 49.61676 49.61676 51.37553 52.34907 ## 2 61.44975 61.44975 61.50272 60.68005 60.68005 60.68005 60.69364 55.45382 ## 3 66.74441 66.74441 67.09590 67.45034 67.45034 67.45034 67.84171 67.23681 ## cm rcm rm lwb ldm cdm rdm rwb ## 1 52.34907 52.34907 51.37553 58.02940 58.74738 58.74738 58.74738 58.02940 ## 2 55.45382 55.45382 60.69364 48.77978 46.17365 46.17365 46.17365 48.77978 ## 3 67.23681 67.23681 67.84171 65.51366 65.15720 65.15720 65.15720 65.51366 ## lb lcb cb rcb rb ## 1 59.04722 61.46831 61.46831 61.46831 59.04722 ## 2 46.67171 42.25534 42.25534 42.25534 46.67171 ## 3 64.39463 62.41962 62.41962 62.41962 64.39463 The third cluster (blue) has a higher “overall”, “value” and “wage” than the others. It is therefore constituted by the good and famous players. The main difference between the 2 other clusters is the height and the weight: the second cluster (red) being taller and heavier than the first cluster (green). We can therefore guess that the bottom-to-top vector (pca_2) conveys a meaning of corpulence or, maybe, of position. Finally, let’s have a look at the decomposition of the PCA vectors on the original features. ## PC1 PC2 ## overall -0.140523693 0.086703572 ## potential -0.090435065 0.035016238 ## value_eur -0.084353301 0.036262081 ## age -0.061356100 0.069723915 ## height_cm 0.042433553 0.077178168 ## weight_kg 0.021479732 0.077799757 ## league_level 0.025426437 -0.012857498 ## club_jersey_number 0.018948503 -0.040080451 ## weak_foot -0.058222787 -0.029819159 ## skill_moves -0.116265304 -0.063005117 ## international_reputation -0.071856297 0.035910279 ## pace -0.070280469 -0.091149886 ## shooting -0.143777955 -0.104736618 ## passing -0.164980344 0.028876908 ## dribbling -0.165759524 -0.045548935 ## defending -0.009205539 0.230880807 ## physic -0.040105643 0.155624325 ## attacking_crossing -0.133899240 0.002892932 ## attacking_finishing -0.128664075 -0.128067284 ## attacking_heading_accuracy -0.025076435 0.101686551 ## attacking_short_passing -0.148360162 0.069723984 ## attacking_volleys -0.128600098 -0.098078062 ## skill_dribbling -0.155804844 -0.063167006 ## skill_curve -0.143659774 -0.039895559 ## skill_fk_accuracy -0.126509388 -0.024262092 ## skill_long_passing -0.125487893 0.096516197 ## skill_ball_control -0.162693501 -0.006901399 ## movement_acceleration -0.072708916 -0.095253248 ## movement_sprint_speed -0.064027132 -0.082190200 ## movement_agility -0.105614397 -0.084447787 ## movement_reactions -0.131043993 0.084629586 ## movement_balance -0.073426361 -0.073933592 ## power_shot_power -0.136489683 -0.043406020 ## power_jumping -0.010232627 0.079252791 ## power_stamina -0.084355115 0.091153270 ## power_strength -0.004567688 0.117585047 ## power_long_shots -0.144640948 -0.071802689 ## mentality_aggression -0.043592747 0.171457441 ## mentality_interceptions -0.014079449 0.223048042 ## mentality_positioning -0.143555102 -0.092398259 ## mentality_vision -0.154591563 -0.027775141 ## mentality_penalties -0.110843557 -0.091590110 ## mentality_composure -0.137894200 0.054452687 ## defending_marking_awareness -0.010257415 0.221490101 ## defending_standing_tackle -0.003628388 0.223396363 ## defending_sliding_tackle 0.003188535 0.220795425 ## ls -0.162430468 -0.058564565 ## st -0.162430468 -0.058564565 ## rs -0.162430468 -0.058564565 ## lw -0.169657617 -0.059577445 ## lf -0.170018930 -0.059129286 ## cf -0.170018930 -0.059129286 ## rf -0.170018930 -0.059129286 ## rw -0.169657617 -0.059577445 ## lam -0.173197226 -0.039850438 ## cam -0.173197226 -0.039850438 ## ram -0.173197226 -0.039850438 ## lm -0.173060439 -0.030320777 ## lcm -0.167769487 0.060085213 ## cm -0.167769487 0.060085213 ## rcm -0.167769487 0.060085213 ## rm -0.173060439 -0.030320777 ## lwb -0.097181449 0.184855039 ## ldm -0.079955298 0.208677637 ## cdm -0.079955298 0.208677637 ## rdm -0.079955298 0.208677637 ## rwb -0.097181449 0.184855039 ## lb -0.072772615 0.205754632 ## lcb -0.030014201 0.231763787 ## cb -0.030014201 0.231763787 ## rcb -0.030014201 0.231763787 ## rb -0.072772615 0.205754632 We can indeed conclude that: pca_1 gives a bigger and negative weight to the skills and salary pca_2 gives a bigger weight to height and weight It is confirmed by a rapid hovering of the graph. The leftmost players (Mbappe, Messi, De Bruyne, Neymar) are known to be very good and very well paid. On the top we have Ruben Dias, Laporte, Van Dijk who are known to be very tall and powerful ; while on the bottom we have Muriel, Insigne or Coman wo are short and fast. 4.5 Where are the best players from ? 4.5.1 All the players Where is football a popular sport ? Europe and South America for sure, but FIFA shows players coming from all around the world. This map will show where they are from. We can see that Brazil, Argentina, Spain, France and Germany are the most represented countries, with around 1000 players each. But even though it is not the national sport, there are about 400 Americans and Chinese present in the game! On the contrary, football is very popular in Africa, but very few African players are represented. It is probably because the African leagues are not yet in the game. 4.5.2 Top 1000 players It may be interesting to see if the countries with the most players are also the countries with the best players. For this purpose, we plot the same chart, but with only the 1000 players with the highest overall ranking. We can see that Spain is by far the best country in 2022, followed by Brazil, Argentina and France. It is interesting to highlight that although Germany had 4 times the number of Italian players represented in FIFA (1200 VS 300), they both have approximately 50 players in the top 1000. Same remark for USA VS Canada. 4.6 Analysis of Male vs Female Salaries In this part, we want to identify how salaries between men and women compare. The scope of the study will focus on the male players during the year 2021-22. 4.6.1 Overall Distribution of Male and Female Salaries We are first going to look at the overall distribution of players’ annual salaries for both male and female. We obviously expect the median salary of the men to be larger than the median height of women. We can clearly see that the average male player is makes more than the average female player. The distribution of female annual salaries is heavily skewed to the right whereas much less for men. The distribution also shows that some men tend to make extremely high amounts of money (although this is only restrained to the best players) whereas not all at all for women. 4.6.2 Key Statistics Comparison of Annual Wage for Male and Female Players ## [1] &quot;Median Male Player Salary: 208000 €&quot; ## [1] &quot;Median Female Player Salary: 45875.5555555556 €&quot; ## [1] &quot;Max Male Player Salary: 29900000 €&quot; ## [1] &quot;Max Female Player Salary: 104000 €&quot; ## [1] &quot;Min Male Player Salary: 26000 €&quot; ## [1] &quot;Min Female Player Salary: 26000 €&quot; From the key statistics above, we can see how significant the differences are between women and men in terms of salaries… Although the minimum annual wages are the same for both men and women, the maximum women player annual salary is half the amount of the median of male annual salaries. Lastly, the highest paid male in the game is paid close to 30M€ annually, more than 300 times what the highest paid female receives (104k€). This difference clearly needs to be reduced… 4.6.3 Median Player Salaries per Position We will now compare the median salaries of both female and male players per position to see if there are some positions with an advantage in terms of salary in comparison to others. We will again be using the data from 2022 only. Since most players play more than one position, we will include a row in our data for each position that the player plays. Thus, some (if not most) players will be included in the salary calculations for multiple positions. The Cleveland Dot Plot above provides many interesting insights. To begin with, all median salaries of men are higher than those of women. For men, it looks like the higher one plays on the pitch, the more one gets paid. This is not the case for women where most positions seem to have the same median salary and CAM (midfielder) is the position that is paid the most (same as the worst paid position for men, goalkeeper).

We were able to analyse the player heights and confirm their normal distribution for both men and women. We also saw that heights were different depending on the player position. Moreover, after performing dimensionality reduction using PCA, we saw that there are certain features that contribute more than others to a player having a better overall score and a higher market value. We then compared men and women salaries and confirmed the great disparities between them, something that must be seriously changed for the development of women football. Lastly, using the highcharter package, we checked where the best players were from and saw that Spain is by far the best country in 2022, followed by Brazil, Argentina and France. Our study was limited by the fact that this is data from a video game (so not completely accurate) but overall, it did confirm the assumptions that we had prior to starting our analysis of the dataset. It would be amazing to be able to do more analysis of the different versions of the game (compare our results for FIFA15 to FIFA22) rather than solely concentrate ourselves on the latest version of the game. This project was extremely insightful as it allowed us to apply the different skills learned in class (data cleaning and transformation), D3 for the interactive component and how to make impactful visualizations.
